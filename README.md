# Deloitte-NCAA-March-Madness-Data-Crunch-Competition

Introduction

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Basketball Tournament is informally referred to as "March Madness". With 68 college basketball teams competing in a single-elimination tournament, March Madness is played every spring in the US to determine the national championship of the major college basketball teams. Based on Kaggleâ€™s Machine Learning Mania (which is later cancelled due to COVID-19), competitors of 2020 Deloitte March Data Crunch Madness predict the probability that a team wins any given game in the 2020 Tournament. Logloss is used as evaluation. Extensive historical data to jump-start the modeling process is gived. Competitors are encouraged to incorporate their own sources of data. The whole competition is exclusive to Fordam students and is sponsored by Deloitte.

Objective

The core goal of this project is to predict the probability that a team wins any given game in the March Madness Tournament, past data from 2002 until 2019 were given as a combined dataset with fixed format. All possible 2278 matches were required to be predicted in the submission dataset.  

Grading Criterion

Judges will grade the submission on factors including model accuracy, creativity of EDA & Methodology, and final delivery and communication. To be more specific, model accuracy is not the only metric, but the whole process to discover and analyze patterns as well as to effectively communicate is more important.
